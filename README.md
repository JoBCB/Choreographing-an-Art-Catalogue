# Choreographing-an-Art-Catalogue
_Workshop by [Joana Chicau](https://www.joanachicau.com/about.html)_

> "By embodiment, I mean the ways in which we know and move in the world. I, therefore, understand embodiment as a process, which is important in archival contexts as archives continue to collect and describe records and collections that grow, shift, and may become meaningful over time. Archives, like bodies, are always becoming and unbecoming." _Jamie Ann Lee, A Queer/ed Archival Methodology: Archival Bodies as Nomadic Subjects_

A workshop open to artists, designers, curators, and anyone curious to explore the notion of cataloguing: the articulations between bodi(es)-time(s)-space(s). The workshop may be seen as a temporary lab to collectively share methodologies and discover modes of structuring new cataloguing possibilities, formats and frictiions.

The outcome of the workshop is a prototype of a new catalogue for the current exhibition. The catalogue as the culmination of cultural bodies; political bodies; poetic bodies; imaginative bodies and the power to evoke other future anatomies to come — opening up the horizon of what a catalogue is; or can be.

The participants are invited to bring their own laptops, and engage with hybrid analogue and digital tools, privileging open source and libre software.

__On method__ = Drawing on practices of notation (making of scores and scripts) interweaved with somatic practices (embodiment and sensory perception) — which will inform archiving practices (gestures of searching, collecting; structuring, publishing and archiving content);

> Choreographies are socio-cultural constructions, critics to current systems, political positions or dispositions, alternatives to move or counter-move. Each epoch, each place, each culture, each instance of choreography resists and reform previous conceptions of its definition.

> As in choreography, computer programming deals with space, time and movement constructs. It has been defining ways of moving collectively or individually, through fluid nonetheless complex landscapes of information displays, networked spaces, and multi-media environments. — _[Joana Chicau, Choreo-graphic-hypothesis publication]_(https://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Choreo-graphic-hypothesis-web-joana-chicau.pdf)

“What strategies might archivists consider to expand contextual knowledge about historical matters that might constrain records and bodies of knowledge over time? (...) Projecting the ideas of the fractured subject into the archive, Jacques Derrida wrestles with the changing nature of the archive by looking at what constitutes the driving principle of gathering together: "Consignation (in the archive) aims to coordinate a single corpus, in a system or a synchrony in which all the elements articulate the unity of an ideal configuration. In an archive, there should not be any absolute dissociations, any heterogeneity or secret, which could separate, or partition, in an absolute manner." _Jacques Derrida, Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995)_

“Through poststructural and postmodern thought, then, the archival body is no longer ‘an ideal configuration.’ It is not stable nor can it perform stability when it holds fractured and fracturing histories. Although fractured, the center does not necessarily cease to be a dominating force.” — _Braidotti, Metamorphoses_

“To explore the nature of ‘thinking in action’ or thinking-feeling-knowing’ operative within artistic practice, especially produced within collaborative exchange..” — _[Emma Cocker, et al.](http:// www.choreo-graphic-figures.net/publications/book)_

“... an approach to research-creation as a practice of interdisciplinary event design, or to quote the original application, as the practice of creating innovative ‘platforms for organizing and orienting live, collaborative encounters.’” — _[Erin Manning, et al.](http://senselab.ca/wp2/immediations/anarchiving/ anarchive-concise-definition)_

“Archivists who are able to embrace the metamorphoses of process—as opposed to adopting and adapting to the teleological and linear thrust toward static records as the sole outcome of archival productions—might then engage critically and creatively with the dynamic relationships among the archival functions and elements, creators, records, technologies, and structures. Critical engagements will not eliminate archival structures or standards, but might open the archival processes to dynamic methodologies in order to elicit ongoing thought and interrogation into everyday practices.” — _Jamie Ann Lee, A Queer/ed Archival Methodology: Archival Bodies as Nomadic Subjects_

"The body is an arrangement in spacetime, a patterning, a process; the mind is a process of the body, an organ, doing what organs do: organize. Order, pattern, connect... an immensely flexible technology, or life strategy, which if used with skill and resourcefulness presents each of us with that most fascinating of all serials, The Story of My Life." — _Ursula K. Le Guin, Dancing at the Edge of the World: Thoughts on Words, Women, Places_

__On the floor: breathing__

 * how is your body feeling today?
 * feel the weight and lightness of you body; pressing the surrounding surfaces; the limits between surfaces.
 * in anatomy, the dorsal surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top. How hard is your head pressing the ground?
 * keep the shoulders loose, relaxed and low, the neck stretched;
 * the ventral surface (or 'belly') refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism. Release any tension you feel there.
 * feel any other tensions in the rest of your body, such as the stress on the ligaments of different joints from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet — release them by doing short slow vibratory movements.
 * keep breathing.
 * breathing is the bridge between the voluntary and involuntary — the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system; the conscious and the unconscious; the inner and the outer.
 * activate the circulation.
 * inhalation (contract the abdomen)  > Retention (3-5sec)  > Exhalation (expand the abdomen);
 * breathing deeply helps circulation and oxygenation of the brain. Airstreams, generative circulation;
 * the brain is irrigated by 2000 liners of blood everyday and this blood passes through many miles of capillaries.
 * you are part of a vast circulatory network; which connects organs, functions, enactments.
 * organ is the mother word for organ—ization.
 * continue breathing. In and outward.
 * imagine a map inside you consisting of arteries and veins. Move through this pathways within your body;
 * like a mapping exercise. Feel the empty spaces; the in-betweens.
 * imagine anatomical lines drawn through structures, circumventing anatomical locations.
 * feel the distance between; the voids in between your arteries beneath your skin;
 * “Distad" means "in the distal direction", and "distad of the femur" means "beyond the femur in the distal direction".
 * feel the distance between… your left hand and your lower lip; right elbow to the right knee;
 * the abdomen, or inferior ventricle and the liver.
 * feel the distance between your forearm to the ankles; the distance between your shoulder blade to your chin; Feel the proximal (or 'nearest') organ to your cornea, in your left eye. Feel the distal (meaning 'to stand away from') organ from your your right nostril.
 * locate and touch your fourth cervical vertebra. Locate the navel which is intermediating the left arm and the contralateral (or right) leg.
While seemingly possible to map all the distances, the sacrum and coccyx are fused, and so they are not often used to provide location.
 * continue breathing.
 * inter- (from Latin inter, meaning 'between'): between two other structures, such as the intercostal muscles running between the ribs.
 * feel the distance between your the pelvis and your neck and your throat.
 * from your wrists towards or up to the tip of your fingers;
 * consider subcutaneous, beneath the skin, the subterminal area near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean "nearly" or "more-or-less"; for instance subglobular means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to "hypo-“. Like as in hypolingual nerve beneath the tongue. Vocalizing anatomies, theorizing the body, flesh.
 * caudal (or the 'tail') is used to describe how close something is to the trailing end of an organism. What is the equivalent in your body?
 * visualize and light up your spine travelling from the tip of the tailbone, vertebra by vertebra up into the skull.
 * use your chin to align help align the spine.
 * the spine is just one of many possible movement centres. The center, the medial. The body as poly centric. Polyrhythmic.
 * from the centre to the edges. Feel the extremity of other body parts, your neck; your stomach; your toes.
 * where does your body end? Where does it begin?

__Breath — standing__

You can walk slowly through the space; and feel the distances in-between.

Soft focus is a physical state in which the eyes are relaxed so that, rather than looking at a specific object or person, the individual allows visual information to come to her/him. With focus softened in the eyes, the individual expands the range of awareness, especially peripherally.

 * walk around and observe the environment;  let breathing guide your walk; 
 * feel the sources of light in the room. Dance off the light in the room. 
 * notice if you make shadows, sound, how do you change or affect the environment;
 * now be attentive to the shapes, textures, symmetry versus asymmetry and when one particular element catches your attention stop in front of it.
 * observe its size, shape of that body. Look at it from different perspectives; move your body around it. Touch it if you may.
 * describe it in words and sensations: “I smell… I see…” 
 * develop a relationship with it. Let it taunt you, challenge you, give you an obstacle. See it and exploit it for its raw qualities rather than its functional ones.
 * how does that relate to other surrounding objects and bodies in space.
 * close your eyes and remember the same element. What other memories doe sit bring you? What ideas, moments, images?
 * with your eyes closed, create a gesture towards the element with a clear beginning and end; 
 * repeat it several times, making sure the form is exact and repeatable; 
 * perform the action in a fast tempo; in a slow tempo — feel how that interferes with different part of you body and your whole body
 * walk around the space, for a minute;  be attentive to how you do so, 
 * are you following others rhythms, or your own rhythm. Are you creating a particular floor partner? Or e enjoying a free flow around the room?
 * take a deep breath and walk the longest distance you can using that same breath; when you are out of breath stop; 
 * approach the person closer to you and exchange gestures; go back to your first element and perform the new gesture towards it.
